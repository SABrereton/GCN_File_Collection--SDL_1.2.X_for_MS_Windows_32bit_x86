# GCN File Collection
# SDL 1.2.X for Microsoft Windows 32bit x86


### About this document / Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide some information about
this collection of files.


### About the collection

This is a collection of the various .dll library files which are
required to run GCN programs developed to run on systems that use
versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system that run on
32bit x86 compatible system architecture and that use version 1.2.X of
the SDL API and version 1.2.X SDL extention libraries.

Which of the .dll library files are required will depend on the
program as not all of the GCN programs may use the same combination of
SDL and SDL extention library features.


### Installing

Copy the required .dll library files into the same directory/folder
that contrains the .exe executable file of the program that you wish
to run.
